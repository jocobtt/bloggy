## Just another guy making a blog. 

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at SAS Institute Inc in Cary, North Carolina. I love to program (mainly Python, R or Go) and learn new things in my spare time. I love Kubernetes and docker. I also am very interested in infrastructure as code - in particular Terraform. I also lived in Japan for two years and still love to continue to learn the language however I can, which is why this blog also features a Japanese section. 

I graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Applied Statistics and Analytics so I also love Bayesian Statistics, Regression, and AI/ML. 

When I am not studying or working on projects in my spare time I like running, biking, hiking or spending time with friends and family.
