This is my first blog post. Since this is my first post, I will start out with something simple. The other day, while working on this stie actually, I learned about a cool addon that you can do for your Github profile. 


Maybe everyone else knows about this but if you create a repository under your own github username you can then create a `README.md` page that then acts as a landing page for your Github profile. The uses for it are pretty free it seems but it is mainly use to show what sort of things you are working with, allowing you to have more space to post links to your resume, show what you work on by connecting it to your github data etc. etc.
